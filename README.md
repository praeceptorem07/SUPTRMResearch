The purpose of this project is to create a program that generates all Symplectic Upper Right Triangle Rook Matrices.

AdmissibleSubsetGenerator generates all admissible subsets for a symplectic (m x m) matrix in which m = 2 * n.
SymplecticMatrixGenerator is in progress.

All admissible subsets generated from AdmissibleSubsetGenerator are stored in SUPTRMResearch/admissibleSubsets.
The admissible subsets for symplectic (m x m) matrices in which n > 11 have not been recorded due to long run times (n= 12 took over an 1hr30min to generate).
